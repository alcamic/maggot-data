1. Clone this repository in your IDE or VSCODE
```git clone https://github.com/alcamic/maggot-data.git```
2. Make virtual environment in maggot-data
```python -m venv venv```
3. activate your virtual environment in terminal
```venv/Scripts/activate```
4. install library in requirement.txt in terminal
```pip install -r requirement.txt```
5. and have fun (this not include flask app)

**Note**
run the code when the virtual environment is active
``python code.py``
run the code in order ``cropping.py -> maggot_processing.py -> MLP_processing.py``
``single_proses.py`` is for flask when you already run all code in above (for batch training)
